# 20161111 &mdash; Generating Cartograms with Tilegram

This session focuses on [Tilegram](https://pitchinteractiveinc.github.io/tilegrams/), a hex-based cartogram generator. You will not be required to run a local server for this session, though you may find it useful to have a text editor on hand for editing data. If you do not already have a favorite one, go ahead and download [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

#### Ideas
* Customize and export a CSV file in Excel or Google Sheets. Create a cartogram by importing the file into the interface. 
* Download some [Census data](http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml?src=bkmk), format and export it in Excel or Google sheets, and upload the data to build a custom map.
* Export an SVG map and customize it in a vector-based design appication (i.e. Adobe Illustrator or [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/)).
* Use your downloaded [topojson](https://github.com/topojson/topojson) file in combination with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to [render your map](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/) in the browser.
