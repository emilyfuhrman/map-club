# 20161202 &mdash; WORKSHOP (Part II) &mdash; D3.js

The second session of this two-part workshop explores the mapping and geovisualization capabilities of [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.

If you do not already have a text editor, go ahead and download [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/). In addition, you will need to be able to serve files locally. Do this either by running Python's [SimpleHTTPServer](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html) (see [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7943751/what-is-the-python3-equivalent-of-python-m-simplehttpserver) StackOverflow question if you are using Python 3), or by downloading [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/).
