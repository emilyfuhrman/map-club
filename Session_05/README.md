# 20160809 &mdash; D3.js

This session explores the geographic projection capabilities of [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.

In order to explore D3, you need to be able to serve files locally. Do this either by running Python's [SimpleHTTPServer](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html) (see [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7943751/what-is-the-python3-equivalent-of-python-m-simplehttpserver) StackOverflow question if you are using Python 3), or by downloading [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/). 

If you do not already have a favorite text editor, go ahead and download [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
